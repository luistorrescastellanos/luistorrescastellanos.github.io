            <h2>Hobbies & What I Do When I'm Not Working</h2>
            <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me stay balanced and energized. Some of my hobbies include:</p>
            <div class="hobby">
                <img src="climinb_wall.jpg" alt="Climbing Image">
                <div>
                    <h3>Bouldering</h3>
                    <p>I like to go bouldering between two to three times a week. It is a sport that has changed my lifestyle and 
                        moved from the winter sendentarism to become more active. I love to challenge myself to unlock new ways to do the same route just to get
                        to the most efficient one. One important part is that people are climbing gyms are very friendly and I have made my social circle
                        around it.
                        </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby">
                <img src="snowboard.jpg" alt="Snowboarding Image">
                <div>
                    <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
                    <p>Off course only on winter :) ! I'm in between beginner and advanced snowboarder. I started in Bulgaria on the 30th of December of 2023, 
                        broke my coccyx on the 31st :O. That did not stopped me and suddenly in February of 2024 we went to Slovakia, again only for two days but 
                        no injuries. </p>
                       <p> By the end of 2024 again in Bulgaria I was able to do medium-high difficulty level tracks. Even though I fell too many times, still
                           it is one of the sports hat I would love to do more often and it is also a great way to stay active in the winter.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby">
                <img src="guitar.jpg" alt="Guitar Image">
                <div>
                    <h3>Guitar</h3>
                    <p>I like to play electric guitar in my free time. I used to play acoustic but there is something about the pedals and the tube amps
                        that just drives me closer to it. I started learning when I was 17 - acoustic- and just as a hobbie with some friends in 2016 we
                        did a band when I was living in Panama. We used to play from Brit-pop and Grunge to Latin American/Brazilian Covers.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="hobby">
                <img src="reading.jpg" alt="Reading Image">
                <div>
                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                    <p>I like to read books with an interesting background. Fictional stories or magic realism could be the genres I am more into.
                        Also I like to read educational books or articles related to business intelligence and Data Science as things are 
                        changing in a high pace.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Outside of these activities, I also like to travel, explore new places, and spend quality time with my partner, family and friends.</p>
